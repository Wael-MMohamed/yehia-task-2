## Part 2: Feedback Log Application

We try our best to make this exercise as much fun as possible while staying close to what’s actually expected of you in this role.

The purpose of our test task is to get an idea of your development style: how you tackle a problem, the way you structure your code, and your testing strategy.

### Technical Requirements

The challenge is intentionally not very specific on details to give you space for your own decision. To share our expectations we came up with these basic requirements:

- React
- Use Material-UI components
- Use Typescript
- No backend service required
- No need to store data changes persistently
- You can use ONLY state management

### Challenge

We want to build a web application that shows the feedback that we got from customers. By default, you can see the list of all customers who gave feedback. As soon as you click on one of them you will see all their feedback in a list on the right side. You can add customers and related feedback.

### Initial View

When you open the page you will see a list of customers on the left side. The right side is empty.

### Customer View

When you click on a customer, their feedback is showing up on the right side and the customer is highlighted in the list.

### Add Customer

When you click on "add new", a new entry with an input field will show up in the list. You can enter the customer name and when you press the enter key the entry will be saved. You should be able to cancel this process with the pressing of the escape key or clicking away.

### Add Feedback

For adding customer feedback the same logic applies as for adding a new customer.

### Search within Feedbacks

You should be able to search for a word in the feedback list. Results should be filtered on the client-side to only show the feedback which has that search term. The search term should be highlighted in the feedback.

### Bonus

Try to provide unit and integration tests using Jest.

### What we are looking for

We love people who think about the impact of their work on their team. README files that “just work” when followed, commits that form functional units and come with readable commit messages, attention to detail.

### Procedure

1.  Use feedback-log as your working directory
2.  Please do regular commits for your code.
3.  Use of external Free/Open Source libraries is encouraged, where useful.
4.  After your submission, you would be contacted by a member of our team to schedule a workshop appointment. During the workshop, you will present your solution and architectural decisions to our team of developers. We are looking forward to your submission!

### Hint

Try to complete as much as possible of the requirements and submit on the due date.

If you have any questions please let us know! We hope you'll enjoy the assignment.
